# Comment-Sentiment-Analyser
A website that can be used to analyse the sentiment of the comments on social media posts across various platforms. 
The posts can include a YouTube video, a tweet on X.com or a simple body of text from an article or report published online. The comments will be scrapped from these, as their URLs are provided, and sentiments will be shown in categories of positive, negative, and neutral.
This is currently an ongoing project.
